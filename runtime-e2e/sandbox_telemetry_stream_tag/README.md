# Runtime proof — Sandbox-mode telemetry fires with stream=sandbox (v8)

Verifies the v8 contract: a `AxonFlow.sandbox(...)`-constructed client produces
an anonymous heartbeat ping that lands in checkpoint DynamoDB with the row
tagged `stream="sandbox"`.

## When to run

**Post-deploy verification.** Two infrastructure prerequisites:

1. **`axonflow-enterprise` PR #2005 deployed** — without the server-side
   wire-allowlist, the Lambda hardcodes `stream=heartbeat` regardless of
   payload, and this test will fail at the assertion step. Confirm with:
   ```sh
   curl -sS -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"sdk":"typescript","sdk_version":"8.0.0","stream":"community_saas_operational","instance_id":"x"}' \
     https://checkpoint.getaxonflow.com/v1/ping
   # Expect HTTP 400 "invalid stream value"
   ```
2. **AWS credentials** with read on `/aws/lambda/prod-axonflow-checkpoint`.

## Usage

```sh
AWS_REGION=us-east-1 ./test.sh
```

## What it asserts

1. Builds the SDK locally (`npm run build`) — TypeScript npm registry is
   blocked per HARD RULE #6, so we link the local build instead of pulling
   from npm.
2. Runs a tiny Node program against the local SDK that calls
   `AxonFlow.sandbox(...)` pointed at an unreachable agent endpoint
   (`http://localhost:65530`). Pre-v8 this would have produced no
   telemetry; post-v8 the SDK fires its anonymous heartbeat.
3. The Lambda's CloudWatch audit log records an `event_stored` row with
   `sdk=typescript/8` AND `stream=sandbox`.

## Pre-v8 behavior (regression-guard context)

In v7.x, `AxonFlow.sandbox()` set `mode: 'sandbox'` and the SDK gate
short-circuited at `mode !== 'sandbox'`. This silent suppression is the
specific hole this test guards against re-introducing. If a future
refactor restores any mode-based gate, this test fires loudly.
