# Typed policy authoring: the six routes through the agent

`test.mjs` drives `client.typedPolicies` through the BUILT SDK (`dist/`) against a real AxonFlow agent and orchestrator, and asserts what the platform answered to each of the six routes the agent proxies under `/api/v1/typed-policies`.

## What it proves

| Call | Expected answer |
|---|---|
| `active()` before anything is activated | `null`, from the platform's `404 nothing_active` |
| `edition()` | the deployment's root and construct boundary |
| `system()` | the shipped system corpus: its digest and controls |
| `validate(document, fixtures)` | success, with no rejecting finding |
| `publish(document, fixtures)` | a signed artifact's digest |
| `activate(digest)` | success: the digest is promoted to active |
| `active()` after the activation | the document just activated, as the exact signed source; its author is the caller the agent resolved, not the `someone-else` the document names |
| `activate(digest)` again | `TypedPolicyRefusal` with status 409 and reason `activation_refused`: activation promotes, and the version does not advance |
| `publish(document, [])` | `TypedPolicyRefusal` with status 422 and reason `publication_refused`, whose message names the missing fixtures |
| `validate()` on the document with one action changed to `tool.not_registered` | `success` false, with the platform's rejecting finding `ACTION_NOT_REGISTERED` on `grant.refund` |
| `publish()` of that document | `TypedPolicyRefusal` with status 422 and reason `document_refused`, carrying the same finding |

The document is `tests/fixtures/typed-policy-publish-body.json`, the body the platform's own route test proves publishable, marshalled by the platform's own types. The driver gives it a unique `document_id` per run.

## What it does not prove

Rolling back to an earlier document and withdrawing the active one are customer portal operations that the agent does not proxy, so the SDK has no method for either and this driver does not exercise them. The separation-of-duties refusal (`APPROVER_IS_AUTHOR`) needs an edition with separation of duties; the unit tests in `tests/typed-policies.test.ts` assert its shape, and the platform's suites own the rule.

## Running it

Boot a FRESH stack from the platform's main, one on which nothing is active for the organization. Build the SDK, then run the driver:

```bash
npm run compile
AXONFLOW_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
AXONFLOW_CLIENT_ID=runtime-e2e AXONFLOW_CLIENT_SECRET=runtime-e2e-secret \
node runtime-e2e/typed_policies/test.mjs
```

The run writes: it publishes and activates a document, so the organization's active document afterwards is the one the run activated, and a second run against the same stack fails its first assertion.
